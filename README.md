# Ecoa/Bioinsight recruitment test

Thank you for taking this test as part of the recruitment process.
Please read this content carefully.

## Preparation

We strongly suggest you to use the latest version of R and possibly
RStudio. You can install R from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) and
Rstudio from [RStudio
website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop-pro/download-commercial/).

## Objectives

We’ve prepared two small tests for this recruitment process. The idea is
that you will build the best approach to the problem and answer to the
specific questions they propose. You will be asked to send us your
approach and the main outputs in a short data report by Friday 7th.

## Report Detail

Your report must include a short description of your outputs (maps,
figures or tables) necessary to answer the questions. The code used must
be provided with the report.

## Presentation

You will prepare and present a 10 minutes talk about your achievements
for each test focusing on the problem while answering to the questions
and details you may think will help to understand it.  
You can use a R Markdown presentation, a PowerPoint presentation or any
other resource to present it.

## Test 1 - Wind Energy Production in Portugal

### Main questions

-   Map wind energy facilities spatially distributed in mainland
    Portugal.
-   Describe the pattern and its relation with altitude and protected
    areas.
-   What is the total national installed capacity (in GW)?
-   How it has grown since the first installed facility?
-   How it is distributed in the landscape?
-   Are protected areas affected? Where?

### Challenge

Build an interactive map where one can query for each facility the name,
year of construction and installed capacity (using e2p data).

### Data

You will find the baseline data to work in the \~.R/test1/ folder.

| e2p.rda      | location of wind farms with name, date, coordinates and production |
