# Ecoa/Bioinsight recruitment test
Thank you for taking this test as part of the recruitment process. Please read this content carefully.

## Preparation
We strongly suggest you to use the latest version of R and possibly RStudio.
You can install R from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) and Rstudio from [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio-desktop-pro/download-commercial/).

## Objectives
We've prepared two small tests for this recruitment process. 
The idea is that you will build the best approach to the problem and answer to the specific questions they propose.
You will be asked to send us your approach and the main outputs in a short data report by Friday 7th.

## Report Detail
Your report must include a short description of your outputs (maps, figures or tables) necessary to answer the questions. The code used must be provided with the report.

## Presentation
You will prepare and present a 10 minutes talk about your achievements for each test focusing on the problem while answering to the questions and details you may think will help to understand it.  
You can use a R Markdown presentation, a PowerPoint presentation or any other resource to present it.

## Test 1 - Wind Energy Production in Portugal
### Main questions
- Map wind energy facilities spatially distributed in mainland Portugal.
- Describe the pattern and its relation with altitude and protected areas.
- What is the total national installed capacity (in GW)? 
- How it has grown since the first installed facility?
- How it is distributed in the landscape?
- Are protected areas affected? Where?

### Challenge
Build an interactive map where one can query for each facility the name, year of construction and installed capacity (using e2p data).

### Data
You will find the baseline data to work in the ~.R/test1/ folder. 

| Data | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| e2p.rda | location of wind farms with name, date, coordinates and production |
| adm0_pt.rda | Administrative boundary of Portugal ( level 0 ) |
| adm1_pt.rda | Administrative boundary of Portugal ( level 0 ) |
| rn2000.rda | Natura 2000 Sites  |

## Test 2 - Bird movement and tide height

### Questions
- Map bird movements.
- Describe the pattern of bird movement in relation to tide height and distance to next high tide.

Suggestion: retain the first observation of each movement to map the dist

### Data
You will find the baseline data to work in the ~.R/test2/ folder.


| Data | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| bird.rda | location of wind farms with name, date, coordinates and production |
| tide.rda | Administrative boundary of Portugal ( level 0 ) |
